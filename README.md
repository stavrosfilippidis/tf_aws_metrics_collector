# tf_aws_metrics_collector
This module spawns a server that can be configured to fetch, store and provide metrics. 

It's build using the technologies Fedore Core OS and Prometheus. It's not meant to provide 
a production ready metrics collector server but rather an MVP showcasing the flexibility 
and easiness of configuration.
